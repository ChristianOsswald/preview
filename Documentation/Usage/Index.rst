Usage
============

On every page which is not visible in the frontend yet (e.g. the page is deactivated) you find in the page module
a container, where you can generate or delete a preview link for every language available.

Click on "Generate" to generate a preview link and on "Copy" to copy the preview link to the Clipboard. Send this
link to your external partner, which can see the page without being logged in into the system.

Please note: you need a preview link for every page and language!

If you don't need the link anymore (or want to generate another one for any reason), click on "Delete" and the preview link
will be invalidated.

After the validiy period (configurable on Settings -> Extensions -> Preview, default is 7 days) the link will be automatically
invalidated and removed. Of course you're free to generate another one for the same page then, if needed.
